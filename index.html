that's when i feel like my day is made . <br>
i love the way your eyes flutter <br>
and the way you speak a thousand words <br>
in thousand languages within a single blink <br>
i love the way your hair flows along with the wind <br>
and the way it speaks to itself <br>

i know we've fought a lot, babe <br>
ellame for no reason at all <br>
and though it stung back then <br>
looking back at it now i laugh <br>
knowing that i had really won in life <br>
knowing that no matter what happens <br>
break downs and break throughs <br>
we never changed <br>
nothing could ever tear us apart <br>

i'll always be by your side <br>
though your thicks and thins <br>
though anxiety or depression <br>
just pour your heart out to me <br>
 
i wanna show you off to the world <br>
i wanna build towers for you <br>
it's because you're so amazing<br>
and i just wanted to let you know that<br>
i loved you, i love you and <br>
i will love you, <br>
till the sun's ethereal waves burn <br>
till the moon's spotlight shines on you <br>
till the land of the oceans turn into drought <br>
till the end of my life, <br>
until my last breath.<br> 


PS: innum eludhalam nu nenachen aana i can't think of any word appropriate to describe you
